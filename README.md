## Project Overview

This project serves as a proof of concept site for a friend and talented ramen chef, Miura Anjin. It showcases the potential front-end design that could be implemented for their official website. Please note that as of June 2023, this site is still in the prototype stage, serving as a visual representation of a simple "where/when" site concept. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate my front-end development skills and help Miura visualize the potential look and feel of their future site.
